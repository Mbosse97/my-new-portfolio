This repository will track and display my learning development as I continue through the USYD coding bootcamp and my own projects 
I will display my information and projects within this webpage to showcase the things that I have learnt and built in my development
at the moment this webpage is showing contents that is not mine, however i will be continually updating ti to show my progress
i have created this based on a screenshot given to us in the coding bootcamp and have tried to replicate the structure
the main html elements were written first and all sections were subdivided appropriately
the styles applied aim to make the data displayed more appealing to the eye and also create less friction when attempting to view
